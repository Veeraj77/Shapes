Shapes Project

Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of various geometric shapes using object-oriented programming concepts in Java. It includes classes for different shapes such as Circle, Cylinder, Equilateral Pyramid, Rectangle, Sphere, and Square.

Features

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

Class inheritance

Polymorphism

Shape-specific methods

Functions Overview

Circle Class

getArea(): Calculates the area of the circle.

getPerimeter(): Calculates the perimeter of the circle.

Cylinder Class

getVolume(): Calculates the volume of the cylinder.

getSurfaceArea(): Calculates the surface area of the cylinder.

Rectangle Class

getArea(): Calculates the area of the rectangle.

getPerimeter(): Calculates the perimeter of the rectangle.

Square Class

getArea(): Calculates the area of the square.

getPerimeter(): Calculates the perimeter of the square.

Sphere Class

getVolume(): Calculates the volume of the sphere.

getSurfaceArea(): Calculates the surface area of the sphere.

Equilateral Pyramid Class

getVolume(): Calculates the volume of the pyramid.

getSurfaceArea(): Calculates the surface area of the pyramid.

Methods Used

Constructor Methods: Used to initialize objects with default or user-defined values.

Getter Methods: Retrieve the values of private attributes.

Setter Methods: Set or update the values of private attributes.

Calculation Methods: Perform calculations like area, perimeter, volume, and surface area.

Display Methods: Print the properties and calculated results of the shapes.
